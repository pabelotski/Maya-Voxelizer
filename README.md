# Maya-Voxelizer
A python script for Maya 2023 that voxelizes meshes. Guide and examples can be found at https://www.artstation.com/artwork/49lKgk

This script was made for a school project in 2023. There are some things that I could've done better in hindsight, and I originally planned to release a new version that included features like vertex coloring and optimized voxel models by removing overlapping and inward pointing faces. But alas, time is limited, and other projects distracted me long enough that I never got around to it.

You are free to modify or expand the script to suit your needs, and you can use it for commercial uses. All I ask is that you give credit for using my source code. Good luck and enjoy!
